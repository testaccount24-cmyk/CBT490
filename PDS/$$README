      The macros/routine in the INSTASM library are useful in
      building reentrant ASSEMBLER programs.

      They include entry/exit macros, procedure macros, a
      date-processing routine, a messaging routine, a "string" macro
      which combines and edits different fields into a single output
      field, and a parsing macro

      I have used them in system exits such as IEFUJV
